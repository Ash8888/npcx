npcx - npc spawngroups

Source: https://github.com/mixxit/npcx
Test Jar: http://www.gamerservices.net/gs/npcx.jar

Implements everquest style npc spawngroups and allows you to make 
persistent npcs/rare npcs spawn around your map. Npcs will also fight 
back if attacked and even talk on right click.

Version 0.01 - Got a basic implementation going

# Installation Steps
#

Step 1 - Install iConomy
========================
http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/econ-iconomy-4-5-5-elektra-493-556.40/

Step2 - Install MySQL and the MySQL Connector
=============================================

Install MySQL Server on Windows or via your repo manager on linux
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

(Windows) Install MySQL WorkBench to create databases and new accounts on windows
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

(Linux Hosted) Install PHPMyAdmin to create databases and new accounts on linux
http://www.phpmyadmin.net/

------------------------------------
- Using MySQL Workbench on Windows - 
------------------------------------
Login to MySQL Workbench as the root user you created when installing MySQL Server
create a new database called 'npcx'
create a new user called npcx with the password 'p4ssw0rd!' - assign this user ALL privileges to the npcx database

--------------------------------------
- Using mysql command line to create -
--------------------------------------
from mysql -u root -p in linux shell
Code:
CREATE DATABASE npcx;
CREATE USER 'npcx'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'p4ssw0rd!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON npcx.* TO 'npcx'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Create a bukkit/lib folder if you dont have it
Extract the mysql connect jar file from the following zip file): http://mysql.eukhost.com/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.tar.gz
Copy the JAR file (mysql-connector-java-5.1.6-bin.jar) from inside the zip into your bukkit/lib folder.

Step3
=====

Add npcx.jar to your bukkit/plugins folder

Step4
=====

If your world name is different to 'world' you will need to now close bukkit, edit your npcx.properties file and change world to the correct worldname

Step5
=====

Launch bukkit and login as an OP

Step 6
======
Begin creating your first spawn group at your location with

Code:
/npcx spawngroup create myfirstgroup
Now create an npc called Guard
Code:
/npcx npc create Guard
Now add guard's id to your spawn group number
Code:
/npcx spawngroup add 1 1

Guard should now spawn permanently at the spawngroups location.

Right clicking will begin (T) chat with him. Moving out of range or right clicking him again will end chat.

To have him respond to words or change his default response, see the sections below.


Using NPCX
===========


Creating Spawngroups

Spawngroups are placed at any X Y Z co-ordinate and contain a group of npcs. Any one of them could spawn. Spawngroups can also be empty. They are the basis for static npc spawning.

Add npcs to the spawngroup by using the /npcx spawngroup add command. An npc out of this group will now spawn at the designated position.

Code:
/npcx spawngroup create spawngroupname - Adds a new blank spawngroup container at your position
/npcx spawngroup add spawngroupid npcid - Adds an npc to the spawngroup container
/npcx spawngroup list - lists all spawngroups
Overview:

A spawngroup is like a container. It contains many npcs and any one of them could spawn randomly. If you placed just one npc in the group only one npc would spawn. This allows you to create 'rare' npcs by having lots of the same npc in a container and then 1 rare.
Spawngroups need to be assigned to a location, which is assigned based on the admins location. Once assigned that group will spawn in that location and remain stationary

If a path is assigned to the spawn group, the npc will follow the path continuously after spawning

Once an NPC in a SpawnGroup dies a new npc will be chosen out of the spawn group to spawn in its place after a default set time (ie 20 minutes) at the location of 'spawngroup place'

todo: functionality
adds an npc to a spawngroup with a chance to spawn percentage
move spawngroup spawn at your location
assigns a path to the spawngroup

Creating NPCs

Code:
/npcx npc spawn name - Temporarily spawns an npc at your spot
/npcx npc create name - Creates a new npc (that needs to be added to a spawngroup)
/npcx npc list Lists all npcs (this needs to support querying by name output limits)
Overview:
NPCs are just that, definitions of the mob you want to appear in game. There can be multiple of the same. They are temporary and do not return after death.

An npc can be in many spawngroups, for example if you wanted a custom npc called 'Thief' to spawn in several locations you would put the npc into many spawn groups
Npcs have chat responses attached to them that allow them to offer quests and have alternate greeting messages.

In the future these npcs will support npctypes which determines how the npc will respond to 
right click, attack, etc events

ie for: bankers, normal npcs, merchants etc
Also loottables will be assignable

todo: functionality
creates a new npc with name

Adding NPCs to containers

Code:
/npcx spawngroup add groupid npcid

get these from spawngroup list and npc list

Quest System / Chat to NPCs

Right clicking an npc sets it as your chat target. You can say anything to the npc using the usual (T) chat command.

The npc will then run this text through myNPC.parseChat()

You can get an npc to respond to triggerwords with predefined responses which admins will be able to attach to an npc using slash commands such as 'Hello' responding with 'Hello, do you want to help with a [quest]' which leads onto the next chat response of 'Quest'
Syntax

Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add NPCID word response as long as you like
Adding a new triggerword called 'default' to an npc will override the npcs default response to unknown questions

ie:
Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add 1 default My default response!
Note: An npc without any triggerwords will respond with 'Im sorry name im rather busy right now'
Note: you cannot talk to temporary 'spawn' npcs as they have no responses configured

Events in responses
Syntax: /npcx npc response
Added 'npcattack' event to triggerword responses - If you setup a response for example:
Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add NPCID TRIGGERWORD NPCATTACK
- then the npc will only attack when spoken to.

Or a scenario like this:
Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add 1 default Dont call me an idiot
Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add 1 idiot NPCATTACK
Chat Variables

bankbalance
Placing the text bankbalance in a triggerword reply will have the NPC respond with the players iconomy bank balance

NPC Shops

Similar to chat, npc shops can be accessed by right clicking the npc and taking to them.

To change an npc from a normal type into a shop type
Code:
/npcx npc category NPCID shop
Begin talking to the npc to buy and sell from it

NPC Combat

Npcs will currently engage in combat and chase anyone that attacks them. When they die, they will be gone forever unless a spawngroup respawns them.
Npcs will also attack nearby monsters
Need to add loottables to onnpcdeath and perhaps an area of effect 'panic' that will request other npcs around it come to its aid
Also need to implement factions to cause a permanent faction hit for a player when murdering an npc

Making NPCs attack players

First create a faction with a baseamount of anything lower than -1000
Code:
/npcx faction create -1000 Bandits
Get the faction id with
Code:
/npcx faction list
Assign the faction to the npc, his faction will now be aggressive to anyone by default and he will now attack players.
Code:
/npcx npc faction FACTIONID
Adding loot to NPCs

First create a loottable with a name to describe its content
/npcx loottable create banditloot

Now get the ID of banditloot
Code:
/npcx loottable list
Now assign an item to the loottable
Code:
/npcx loottable add LOOTTABLEID ITEMID AMOUNT
Now assign the loottable to the npc
Code:
/npcx npc loottable LOOTTABLEID
Path Groups - (WIP)

NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
Overview:

Path groups are containers of path locations assigned to SpawnGroups. They are used to determine the route of an npc after it spawns

Create a pathgroup container
Code:
/npcx pathgroup create Name

then
Code:
/npcx pathgroup list

to get the ID
Stand where you want position 1 to be
Code:
/npcx pathgroup add PATHGROUPID POSITIONNO

Stand where you want position 2 to be
Code:
/npcx pathgroup add PATHGROUPID POSITIONNO

Then assign the path to a spawngroup
Code:
/npcx spawngroup pathgroup SPAWNGROUPID PATHGROUPID
