# Installation Steps
#


Step1 - Install MySQL
=============================================

- > Install MySQL Server on Windows or via your repo manager on linux
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

- > (Windows) Install MySQL WorkBench to create databases and new accounts on windows
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

- > (Linux Hosted) Commandline option

----------------------------------------------
- Using MySQL Workbench on Windows to create - 
----------------------------------------------
Login to MySQL Workbench as the root user you created when installing MySQL Server
create a new database called 'npcx'
create a new user called npcx with the password 'p4ssw0rd!' - assign this user ALL privileges to the npcx database

Steps:

Create a new database in MySQL Workbench
In work bench create a new connection on the left under SQL Development using your user/pass (probably root) then on the top left click Add Schema, just name 'npcx' then press Apply

Create a new user in MySQL Workbench
Now come out of SQL Development and go to the right of workbench and into Server Administration, connect again using the details above and click Users and Privileges on the left - now click Add Account in the bottom left and fill in the details : npcx for the username, p4ssw0rd! for the password and then press Apply

Now goto the schema privileges tab above select npcx on the user list on the left and click Add Entry click Schemas matching pattern or name and select npcx, press OK

--------------------------------------------
- Linux using mysql command line to create -
--------------------------------------------
from linux shell:
mysql -u root -p
Code:
CREATE DATABASE npcx;
CREATE USER 'npcx'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'p4ssw0rd!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON npcx.* TO 'npcx'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Step2
=============================================
Install the mysql connector for npcx

Create a bukkit/lib folder if you dont have it
Extract the mysql connect jar file from the following zip file): http://mysql.eukhost.com/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.tar.gz
Copy the JAR file (mysql-connector-java-5.1.6-bin.jar) from inside the zip into your bukkit/lib folder.

Step3
=============================================

Add npcx.jar to your bukkit/plugins folder

Step4
=============================================

If your world name is different to 'world' you will need to now close bukkit, edit your npcx.properties file and change world to the correct worldname

Step5
=============================================

Launch bukkit and login as an OP

Step 6
=============================================
Begin creating your first spawn group at your location with

Code:
/npcx spawngroup create myfirstgroup     <--- creates a spawngroup called myfirst group
* REMEMBER THE SPAWNGROUP ID THIS GIVES YOU
Now create an npc called Guard
Code:
/npcx npc create Guard      <----- creates a guard called Guard
* REMEMBER THE NPCID THIS GIVES YOU
Now add guard's id to your spawn group number
Code:
/npcx spawngroup add SPAWNGROUPID(NUMBER) NPCID(NUMBER)   <--- adds npc ID (number) to spawngroup ID (number)

Guard should now spawn permanently at the spawngroups location.

Right clicking will begin (T) chat with him. Moving out of range or right clicking him again will end chat.

To have him respond to words or change his default response, see the sections below.


Using NPCX
=============================================


Creating Spawngroups
=============================================

Spawngroups are placed at any X Y Z co-ordinate and contain a group of npcs. Any one of them could spawn. Spawngroups can also be empty. They are the basis for static npc spawning.

Add npcs to the spawngroup by using the /npcx spawngroup add command. An npc out of this group will now spawn at the designated position.

Code:
/npcx spawngroup create spawngroupname <----- Adds a new blank spawngroup container at your position
/npcx spawngroup add spawngroupid(NUMBER) npcid(NUMBER) <------ Adds an npc to the spawngroup container
/npcx spawngroup list - lists all spawngroups
Overview:

A spawngroup is like a container. It contains many npcs and any one of them could spawn randomly. If you placed just one npc in the group only one npc would spawn. This allows you to create 'rare' npcs by having lots of the same npc in a container and then 1 rare.
Spawngroups need to be assigned to a location, which is assigned based on the admins location. Once assigned that group will spawn in that location and remain stationary

If a path is assigned to the spawn group, the npc will follow the path continuously after spawning

Once an NPC in a SpawnGroup dies a new npc will be chosen out of the spawn group to spawn in its place after a default set time (ie 20 minutes) at the location of 'spawngroup place'

todo: functionality
adds an npc to a spawngroup with a chance to spawn percentage
move spawngroup spawn at your location
assigns a path to the spawngroup

Creating NPCs
=============================================

Code:
/npcx npc create name <---- Creates a new npc (that needs to be added to a spawngroup)
/npcx npc list <---- Lists all npcs (this needs to support querying by name output limits)
Overview:
NPCs are just that, definitions of the mob you want to appear in game. There can be multiple of the same. They are temporary and do not return after death.

An npc can be in many spawngroups, for example if you wanted a custom npc called 'Thief' to spawn in several locations you would put the npc into many spawn groups
Npcs have chat responses attached to them that allow them to offer quests and have alternate greeting messages.

In the future these npcs will support npctypes which determines how the npc will respond to 
right click, attack, etc events

ie for: bankers, normal npcs, merchants etc
Also loottables will be assignable

todo: functionality
creates a new npc with name

Adding NPCs to containers
=============================================

Code:
/npcx spawngroup add spawngroupid(NUMBER) npcid(NUMBER)

get these from spawngroup list and npc list


Quest System / Chat to NPCs

=============================================

Right clicking an npc sets it as your chat target. You can say anything to the npc using the usual (T) chat command.

The npc will then run this text through myNPC.parseChat()

You can get an npc to respond to triggerwords with predefined responses which admins will be able to attach to an npc using slash commands such as 'Hello' responding with 'Hello, do you want to help with a [quest]' which leads onto the next chat response of 'Quest'
Syntax

Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add NPCID(number) wordtorespondon responsegoeshereandcan have spaces
Adding a new triggerword called 'default' to an npc will override the npcs default response to unknown questions

ie:
Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add NPCID(number) default My default response!
Note: An npc without any triggerwords will respond with 'Im sorry name im rather busy right now'
Note: you cannot talk to temporary 'spawn' npcs as they have no responses configured

Variables as Triggerwords
-------------------------
Added 'EVENT_DEATH' - Triggers when player kills an npc
Added 'EVENT_KILLED' - Triggers when npc kills a player
Added 'EVENT_DEATH' - Triggers when a player bounces an npc
Added 'EVENT_CLOSE' - Triggers when a player becomes close to an npc
Added 'ATTACK' - Triggers when an npc becomes attacked by a player

Events in responses
-------------------
Syntax: 
Added 'NPCSUMMONPLAYER' event to triggerword responses <--- Summons player to npc
Added 'NPCSUMMONZOMBIE' event to triggerword responses <--- Summons one zombie at npc
Added 'NPCATTACK' event to triggerword responses - <--- Forces npc to attack player
Added 'NPCSUMMONWOLF' event to triggerword responses - <--- Summons one wolf at the npc

Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add NPCID(NUMBER) TRIGGERWORD NPCATTACK <--- attacks based on triggerword
- then the npc will attack when spoken to.

Or a scenario like this:
Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add NPCID(NUMBER) default Dont call me an idiot <--- when a player says anything it will return Dont call me an idiot
Code:
/npcx npc triggerword add NPCID(NUMBER) idiot NPCATTACK <--- when a player says idiot it will attack him

Chat Variables in responses
--------------------------
Added 'bankbalance' -Placing the text bankbalance in a triggerword reply will have the NPC respond with the players bank balance
Added 'playername' - Placing the text playername in a triggerword reply will have the NPC respond with the players name
Added 'playerbalance' - Placing the text playerbalance in a triggerword reply will have the NPC respond with the players bank balance


NPC Merchants
=============================================

Similar to chat, npc merchants can be accessed by right clicking the npc and taking to them.

Merchants can also be configured with custom triggerwords, just like a normal NPC

To change an npc from a normal type into a merchant type
Code:
/npcx npc category NPCID(number) merchant   <--- Transforms the npc into a merchant
Begin talking to the npc to buy and sell from it

To load it with items as an admin create a merchant list

/npcx merchant create merchantlistname  <---- creates a merchantlist named whatever
add stuff to it like goldingots (id 266)
/npcx merchant add MERCHANTID(NUMBER) ITEMID AMOUNT PRICETOBUYAT PRICETOSELLAT <---- adds an item to a merchant list

Attach the merchant list to an npcID
/npcx npc merchant NPCID MERCHANTID(NUMBER) <---- attachs a merchantlist to an npc

NPC Combat
=============================================

Npcs will currently engage in combat and chase anyone that attacks them. When they die, they will be gone forever unless a spawngroup respawns them.
Npcs will also attack nearby monsters
Need to add loottables to onnpcdeath and perhaps an area of effect 'panic' that will request other npcs around it come to its aid
Also need to implement factions to cause a permanent faction hit for a player when murdering an npc

Making NPCs attack players
=============================================

First create a faction with a baseamount of anything lower than -1000

Code:
/npcx faction create -1000 Bandits
Get the faction id with
Code:
/npcx faction list
Assign the faction to the npc, his faction will now be aggressive to anyone by default and he will now attack players.
Code:
/npcx npc faction FACTIONID(number)
Adding loot to NPCs

First create a loottable with a name to describe its content
/npcx loottable create banditloot

Now get the ID of banditloot
Code:
/npcx loottable list
Now assign an item to the loottable
Code:
* YOU MUST USE ITEM NUMBERS FOR THE ITEM ID *
* Reference here: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_values *

/npcx loottable add LOOTTABLEID(NUMBER) ITEMID(NUMBER) AMOUNT

Now assign the loottable to the npc
Code:
/npcx npc loottable NPCID(number) LOOTTABLEID(number)

Path Groups - (WIP)
=============================================

Overview:

Path groups are containers of path locations assigned to SpawnGroups. They are used to determine the route of an npc after it spawns

Create a pathgroup container
Code:
/npcx pathgroup create Name

then
Code:
/npcx pathgroup list

to get the ID
Stand where you want position 1 to be
Code:
/npcx pathgroup add PATHGROUPID(NUMBER) POSITIONNO(NUMBER)

Stand where you want position 2 to be
Code:
/npcx pathgroup add PATHGROUPID(NUMBER) POSITIONNO(NUMBER)

Then assign the path to a spawngroup
Code:
/npcx spawngroup pathgroup SPAWNGROUPID(NUMBER) PATHGROUPID(NUMBER)


Civilisations
============================

This section of the mod is a toggleable option that allows players to purchase areas of the game and protect it for themselves.  My hope with this extension is to allow players to buy town guards, shops they can load with items and also other features like a research/tech tree that players can work on to unlock new features.  

Because this mod has always been about bots it's important to note that this option is false by default. Protection is a big thing for any server admin and I am currently only running this on my server. If you want to try it out feel free but by no-means don't drop your tried and trusted protection system for this one.

This option is enabled via the npcx.properties file

nations=true

This enables players to purchase areas of the world for themselves and grant other players to build in it.

If you do not have iConomy installed, it will fall back on the internal NPCX economy that the bots and banker events use

To compliment this area of the mod you may find the following settings useful

nocreeper=true - no creeper explosions
nowild=true - no building in the wild <-- needs to be tested
nospread=true - no fire spread or lighter usage

Commands
-----------------------
/civ buy - buys a land area for 25000 coin
/civ add playername - adds a new player to your land area
/civ balance  - returns your iconomy balance or npcx balance
/civ here - returns the name and location of the area you are standing in 
/civ abandon - abandons the area returning 5000 coin
/civ pay playername amount - pays playername amount

Op Commands
/npcx civ givemoney playername - adds money to player
/npcx civ money playername - returns playernames balance
/npcx civ unclaim - unclaims an area
